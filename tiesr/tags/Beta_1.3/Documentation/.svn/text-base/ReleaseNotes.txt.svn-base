Introduction
------------

These notes cover release Beta-1.3

This release contains builds that have been tested on Windows, and under Linux
for the x86-64, the ARM running on the Beagle Board (www.beagleboard.org).
Slightly older versions of the code have run successfully on the Logic TI Zoom
OMAP MDP, and the Mistral TI OMAP3503 EVM, and so the present release should
also work on those platforms. Since the TIesr library code is written in C/C++,
one should also be able to easily build it for other platforms.


Changes in This Release
-----------------------

The licensing terms of the TIesr Embedded Speech Recognizer Software have been
changed to use open source licensing. This is reflected in the Software Manifest
found in the Documentation/SoftwareManifest.pdf file, as well as licensing terms
added to files.

Some bug fixes have been made in the TIesrFlex API software to support the
specialized _SIL* models in ARM processors.

Checking of semaphore operations was added in Linux/Unix versions in order
to improve debugging.

Some documentation clarifications were made.

A new document was added which describes the formats of the text and binary
files input to and output by TIesr. This file is found at
Documentation/TIesr_Data_Contents.txt.



Tasks Remaining
---------------

In this release there are still tasks remaining to be accomplished, and these
will be addressed in subsequent releases. The following is a list of tasks
remaining. This list is not complete or organized by priority.

- This release provides the tools necessary to build data file sets so that one
can use TIesr to recognize speech in another language, or with alternative
English data. The provided tools enable: (1) the construction of a pronunciation
dictionary that provides substantial coverage of the language to be recognized;
(2) training a set of pronunciation decision trees from the dictionary; (3)
constructing a compressed dictionary; (4) training a set of phonetic acoustic
models and extracting the information; (5) constructing a tree that represents
acoustic similarities of phones in a language; (6) constructing of data files
for clustering the acoustic feature Gaussian probability density functions used
in acoustic models; (7) compressing the data that stores HMM model transition
probabilities. Some tools that compress the Gaussian mean vectors into a
smaller footprint have not been ported to the release yet. A subsequent
release will contain these tools.

- The TIesr algorithm that returns a confidence measure is designed for larger
vocabulary tasks, where grammars contain many words. The confidence measure
becomes less accurate for small vocabularies. This will be addressed in a
subsequent release.

- TIesr provides many advanced setting capabilites to tune recognizer footprint
and performance. These are not documented in this release. A subsequent release
will document the advanced settings, and provide a technical description of the
recognizer algorithms.

- The TIesr software has been a developing code base written by several
engineers. Much clean-up of the code and addition of comments is needed,
especially in the lower level signal processing APIs.
